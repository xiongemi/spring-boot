[[testing.testcontainers]]
= Testcontainers

The https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] library provides a way to manage services running inside Docker containers.
It integrates with JUnit, allowing you to write a test class that can start up a container before any of the tests run.
Testcontainers is especially useful for writing integration tests that talk to a real backend service such as MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra and others.

In following sections we will describe some of the methods you can use to integrate Testcontainers with your tests.



[[testing.testcontainers.via-junit-extension]]
== Using via @Testcontainers JUnit5 extension

The Testcontainers provides JUnit5 extensions, which can be used to manage containers in your tests.
The extension is activated by applying the `@Testcontainers` annotation from Testcontainers to your test class.

Testcontainers can be used in a Spring Boot test as follows:

include-code::vanilla/MyIntegrationTests[]

This will start up a Docker container running Neo4j (if Docker is running locally) before any of the tests are run.
In most cases, you will need to configure the application to connect to the service running in the container.

In this case the lifecycle of the container instance is managed by Testcontainers, as described in official documentation.


[[testing.testcontainers.via-spring-beans]]
== Using via Spring managed beans

The containers provided by Testcontainers can be managed by Spring Boot as beans.
This method of managing contains can be used in combination with javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.ServiceConnection[format=annotation].

To use Testcontainer contains as Spring beans we need to create a configuration class declaring the container as bean:

include-code::beandeclaration/BeanDeclarationConfig[]

then we can start the container by importing the configuration class in the test class:

include-code::beandeclaration/SpringTest[]


[[testing.testcontainers.via-declaration-classes]]
== Using via importing container declaration classes

A common pattern with Testcontainers is to declare the Container instances as static fields in an interface.
For example the following interface `MyInterface` declares two containers, one named `mongo` of type MongoDB and another named `neo` of type Neo4j:

include-code::importcontainers/MyInterface[]

When you have containers declared in this way, then you can have these containers managed by Spring Boot as beans.
All that is needed to do that is adding javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.context.ImportTestcontainers[format=annotation] to your configuration class as in:

include-code::importcontainers/MyConfiguration[]

TIP: Using interfaces for declaring contains helps with reuse.
When containers are declared in an interface, this can be reused in your javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration[format=annotation] classes and in test classes.


[[test.testcontainers.container-lifecycle]]
== Lifecycle of managed containers

If you have used the annotations and extensions provided by Testcontainers, then the lifecycle of container instances is managed by the Testcontainers.
Please refer to the {url-testcontainres-java-doc}[Testcontainers official documentation] for the information about lifecycle of the containers, when managed by the Testcontainers.

When the containers are managed by Spring as beans, then the lifecycle is clearly defined by Spring.
The container beans are created and started before the beans of other types are created.
This process ensures that any beans, which rely on functionality provided by the containers, can use those functionalities.

The test containers can be started multiple times.
Like any other beans the test containers are created and started once per application context managed by the TestContext Framework.
For details about how TestContext framework manages the underlying application contexts and beans therein, please refer to the {url-spring-framework-docs}[official Spring documentation].

The container beans are stopped after the destruction of beans of other types.
This ensures that any beans depending on the functionalities provided by the containers are cleaned up first.

TIP: When your application beans rely on functionality of containers, prefer configuring the containers as Spring beans.
When containers are managed as Spring beans, then Spring framework ensures that upon start the container beans are started before any beans relying on them.
On shutdown the application beans depending on container functionalities are cleaned up first, and only then are the containers shut down.

NOTE: Having containers managed by Testcontainers instead of as Spring beans provides no guarantee of order in which beans and containers will shutdown.
It can happen that containers are shutdown before the beans relying on container functionality are cleaned up.
This can lead to exceptions being thrown by client beans due to loss of connection for example.

The containers are stopped as part of the application shutdown process, managed by the TestContext framework.
When the application context gets shutdown, the containers are shutdown as well.
This usually happens after all tests using that specific cached application context have finished executing, but may happen earlier depending on the caching behavior configured in TestContext Framework.

It is important to note that a single test container instance can be, and often is, retained across execution of tests from multiple test classes.



[[testing.testcontainers.service-connections]]
== Service Connections

A service connection is a connection to any remote service.
Spring Boot's auto-configuration can consume the details of a service connection and use them to establish a connection to a remote service.
When doing so, the connection details take precedence over any connection-related configuration properties.

When using Testcontainers, connection details can be automatically created for a service running in a container by annotating the container field in the test class.

include-code::MyIntegrationTests[]

Thanks to javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.ServiceConnection[format=annotation], the above configuration allows Neo4j-related beans in the application to communicate with Neo4j running inside the Testcontainers-managed Docker container.
This is done by automatically defining a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.neo4j.Neo4jConnectionDetails[] bean which is then used by the Neo4j auto-configuration, overriding any connection-related configuration properties.

NOTE: You'll need to add the `spring-boot-testcontainers` module as a test dependency in order to use service connections with Testcontainers.

Service connection annotations are processed by javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.ContainerConnectionDetailsFactory[] classes registered with `spring.factories`.
A javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.ContainerConnectionDetailsFactory[] can create a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.service.connection.ConnectionDetails[] bean based on a specific javadoc:org.testcontainers.containers.Container[] subclass, or the Docker image name.

The following service connection factories are provided in the `spring-boot-testcontainers` jar:

|===

| Containers named "openzipkin/zipkin"
|===

[TIP]
====
By default all applicable connection details beans will be created for a given javadoc:org.testcontainers.containers.Container[].
For example, a javadoc:{url-testcontainers-postgresql-javadoc}/org.testcontainers.containers.PostgreSQLContainer[] will create both javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.JdbcConnectionDetails[] and javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.r2dbc.R2dbcConnectionDetails[].

If you want to create only a subset of the applicable types, you can use the `type` attribute of javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.ServiceConnection[format=annotation].
====

By default `Container.getDockerImageName().getRepository()` is used to obtain the name used to find connection details.
The repository portion of the Docker image name ignores any registry and the version.
This works as long as Spring Boot is able to get the instance of the javadoc:org.testcontainers.containers.Container[], which is the case when using a `static` field like in the example above.

If you're using a javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] method, Spring Boot won't call the bean method to get the Docker image name, because this would cause eager initialization issues.
Instead, the return type of the bean method is used to find out which connection detail should be used.
This works as long as you're using typed containers such as javadoc:{url-testcontainers-neo4j-javadoc}/org.testcontainers.containers.Neo4jContainer[] or javadoc:{url-testcontainers-rabbitmq-javadoc}/org.testcontainers.containers.RabbitMQContainer[].
This stops working if you're using javadoc:org.testcontainers.containers.GenericContainer[], for example with Redis as shown in the following example:

include-code::MyRedisConfiguration[]

Spring Boot can't tell from javadoc:org.testcontainers.containers.GenericContainer[] which container image is used, so the `name` attribute from javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.ServiceConnection[format=annotation] must be used to provide that hint.

You can also use the `name` attribute of javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.ServiceConnection[format=annotation] to override which connection detail will be used, for example when using custom images.
If you are using the Docker image `registry.mycompany.com/mirror/myredis`, you'd use `@ServiceConnection(name="redis")` to ensure javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.data.redis.RedisConnectionDetails[] are created.



[[testing.testcontainers.service-connections.ssl]]
=== SSL with Service Connections

You can use the javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.Ssl[format=annotation], javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.JksKeyStore[format=annotation], javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.JksTrustStore[format=annotation], javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.PemKeyStore[format=annotation] and javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.PemTrustStore[format=annotation] annotations on a supported container to enable SSL support for that service connection.
Please note that you still have to enable SSL on the service which is running inside the Testcontainer yourself, the annotations only configure SSL on the client side in your application.

include-code::MyRedisWithSslIntegrationTests[]

The above code uses the javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.PemKeyStore[format=annotation] annotation to load the client certificate and key into the keystore and the and javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.PemTrustStore[format=annotation] annotation to load the CA certificate into the truststore.
This will authenticate the client against the server, and the CA certificate in the truststore makes sure that the server certificate is valid and trusted.

The `SecureRedisContainer` in this example is a custom subclass of `RedisContainer` which copies certificates to the correct places and invokes `redis-server` with commandline parameters enabling SSL.

The SSL annotations are supported for the following service connections:

* Cassandra
* Couchbase
* Elasticsearch
* Kafka
* MongoDB
* RabbitMQ
* Redis

The `ElasticsearchContainer` additionally supports automatic detection of server side SSL.
To use this feature, annotate the container with javadoc:org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.Ssl[format=annotation], as seen in the following example, and Spring Boot takes care of the client side SSL configuration for you:

include-code::MyElasticsearchWithSslIntegrationTests[]



[[testing.testcontainers.dynamic-properties]]
== Dynamic Properties

A slightly more verbose but also more flexible alternative to service connections is javadoc:org.springframework.test.context.DynamicPropertySource[format=annotation].
A static javadoc:org.springframework.test.context.DynamicPropertySource[format=annotation] method allows adding dynamic property values to the Spring Environment.

include-code::MyIntegrationTests[]

The above configuration allows Neo4j-related beans in the application to communicate with Neo4j running inside the Testcontainers-managed Docker container.
